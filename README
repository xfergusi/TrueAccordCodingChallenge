Hello Reviewer,

  The project is built to the requirements found at this page
  https://gist.github.com/jeffling/2dd661ff8398726883cff09839dc316c

  How I spent my time:
       I learned a bit about working with JSON. This took most of my time.
       I first got something working. As you can see from my commits, once I got things working, I then refactored and tested
       I would probably redesign a bit if I had more time. I would also create more tests.
       I made several things public when I should I made them private, this was for ease of coding.

  To run,
    1. The jar is located here in this repo, which doesn't take any arguments and the main class is TrueAccordCodingChallenge
    2. If you want to run via a jUnit test, "TrueAccordCodingChallengeTest", it will run the main class and compare the output to what I believe it should be.
